This repository contains UI helpers and others external smart contracts utilities related with the HopeLend Protocol.

## What is HopeLend?

HopeLend is a decentralized non-custodial liquidity markets protocol where users can participate as suppliers or borrowers. Suppliers provide liquidity to the market to earn a passive income, while borrowers are able to borrow in an overcollateralized (perpetually) or undercollateralized (one-block liquidity) fashion.
